## Credits

Graphcis are made by me willems davy aka joyrider3774 using gimp, based on the colored graphics i had created for the gp2x version, more than a decade ago.

The game uses some assets from assets packs i had bought, which you can not reuse without acquiring a valid license for them:
- winner.wav - Game Music Stingers and UI SFX Pack 2 - WOW Sound - https://www.gamedevmarket.net/asset/game-music-stingers-and-ui-sfx-pack-2/ 
- loser.wav - Bad 05 - Retro Fantasy Music Pack - Joel Steudler - https://joelsteudler.itch.io/retro-fantasy-music-pack-vol-1
- start.wav - bell_large_ringing_01 Pro Sound Collection v1.3 16bit - Gamemaster Audio - https://www.gamedevmarket.net/asset/pro-sound-collection/

It is unknown who created the music and the other sound effects. The game is a port from the gp2x game i made more than a decade ago and i did not keep track of who created these other assets at the time. If you happen to recognize any please let me know!
